**Project Title: Simple C++ Calculator**

## Overview

The Simple C++ Calculator is a versatile command-line application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, on two user-provided numerical inputs. This calculator supports both integers and floating-point numbers, catering to a wide range of computation requirements.

## Features

- Addition: Perform addition of two numbers and obtain the result.
- Subtraction: Perform subtraction of two numbers and display the outcome.
- Multiplication: Conduct multiplication of two numerical inputs and show the product.
- Division: Execute division of two numbers, accounting for both integers and floats.
